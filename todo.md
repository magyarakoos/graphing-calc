# Todo

## Parser
- remove the Parser struct, it doesn't make sense to do it like this
- use the global static constants instead
- move function metadata to a json file

## Drawing
- solve the problem of functions like `tan(x)` not going all the way to the bottom and top
- refactor the coordinate utility such that it handles X and Y coordinates separately

## Other
- figure out a way to input formulas
